## Abstract
Asymptomatic shedding of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) raises the possibility that containment strategies relying on symptom-based ascertainment of index cases will not be successful. Here, we evaluate 247 full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected by UW Hospital and Clinics (UWHC, 122) and the Milwaukee Health Department (MHD, 125) through April 2020 to trace the origins and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wisconsin. Using a combination of approaches, we highlight the differences in outbreak dynamics in these two catchment areas, which are separated by only 112 kilometers. The UWHC catchment area appears to have been seeded by multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2, likely from travelers returning from Europe, resulting in limited community spread beginning around March 2020. In contrast, the MHD catchment area was seeded by relatively few, early introduction points subsequently fueled by extensive community spread. We additionally present evidence for reduced viral spread in the UWHC and MHD areas following the Wisconsin state-wide “Safer At Home” order, which went into effect 25 March, 2020. Overall, these results underscore that early containment efforts did suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wisconsin and highlight differences in the outbreak dynamics in two southern Wisconsin communities, which we posit can be explained, at least in part, by differences in community demographic characteristics.
