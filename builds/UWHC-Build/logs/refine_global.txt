2.34	WARNING: Previous versions of TreeTime (<0.7.0) RECONSTRUCTED sequences of
    	tips at positions with AMBIGUOUS bases. This resulted in unexpected
    	behavior is some cases and is no longer done by default. If you want to
    	replace those ambiguous sites with their most likely state, rerun with
    	`reconstruct_tip_states=True` or `--reconstruct-tip-states`.
