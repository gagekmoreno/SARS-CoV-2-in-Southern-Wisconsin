# Define locations for which builds should be created.
# For each build we specify a subsampling scheme via an explicit key.
# If the name of the focal geography differs from the build name this needs to
# be specified explicity as geographic_name. In addition, we require the
# geographic scale the build focuses on. Together name and scale serve a look-up
# in the geo_hierarchy to define region, country, division, etc
